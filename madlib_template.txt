A superhero named insert is really, really good at insert. They weren't always this way, when they were in insert, all they did was eat insert and say mean things about insert. Then one day, on insert, they stepped on a insert and started to transform. Their boring outfit suddenly became insert and their hair turned insert. The best part was they had insert jewels on their insert that sparkled in the sun. They smelled like insert and knew all the words to insert. Everyone wanted to be their friend so they could insert together. They shared the magic with everyone, and that's how we became superkids.
