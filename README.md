# Mad-Lib
This is a beginner python project.

I wanted to show through this project proficiency in basic list comprehension and file reading. Being scoped as a beginner project, I did not include any exceptions. The program will throw errors if user inputs make that happen.

I tried to show some tricks that I can use given the formatting of a text file. It's nothing too crazy, but I formatted the .txt files in such a way that I could manipulate them. Using different templates would require some specific formatting, such as using 'insert' in the places where inputs should go.
